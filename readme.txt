This Anti-Virus/Anti-Malware plugin searches for Malware and other Virus like threats and vulnerabilities on your server and it helps you remove them.

== Description ==

**Features:**

* Automatic removal of "Known Threats".
* Download definitions of new threat as they are discovered.
* Automatically upgrade vulnerable versions of timthumb scripts.
* Automatically patch wp-login.php to block brute-force attacks.
* Customize Scan Setting.
* Run a Quick Scan or a Complete Scan from the Settings Page.

Updated January-11th

Register this plugin at [GOTMLS.NET](http://gotmls.net/) and get access to new definitions of "Known Threats" and added features like Automatic Removal, plus patches for specific security vulnerabilities like old versions of timthumb. Updated definition files can be downloaded automatically within the admin once your Key is registered. Otherwise, this plugin just scans for "Potential Threats" and leaves it up to you to identify and remove the malicious ones.

NOTICE: This plugin make use of a "phone home" feature to check for updates. This is not unlike what WordPress already does with all your plugins. It is an essential part of any worthwhile security plugin and it is here to let you know when there are new plugin and definition update available. If you're allergic to "phone home" scripts then don't use this plugin (or WordPress at all for that matter).

**Special thanks to:**
* Graeme Morris of socialidentitydesign.com for the logo design.
* Jelena Kovacevic and Andrew Kurtis of webhostinghub.com for providing the Spanish translation.

== Installation ==

1. Download and unzip the plugin into your WordPress plugins directory (usually `/wp-content/plugins/`).
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in your WordPress Admin.
1. Register on gotmls.net to have access to new definitions of "known threats" and added features like automatic removal and automatic security patches from your admin page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I register? =

If you register on [GOTMLS.NET](http://gotmls.net/) you will have access to new definitions of New Threats and added features like automatic removal and patches for specific security threats and vulnerabilities like old versions of timthumb and brute-force attacks on wp-login.php. Otherwise, this plugin only scans for "Potential Threats" on your site, it would then be up to you to identify the good from the bad and remove them accordingly. 

= Why can't I automatically remove the "Potential Threats" in yellow? =

Many of these files may use eval and other powerful PHP function for perfectly legitimate reasons and removing that code from the files would likely cripple or even break your site so I have only enabled the Auto remove feature for "Know Threats".

= How do I know if any of the "Potential Threats" are dangerous? =

Click on the linked filename, then click each numbered link above the file content box to highlight the suspect code. If you cannot tell whether or not the code is malicious just leave it alone or ask someone else to look at it for you. If you find that it is malicious please send me a copy of the file so that I can add it to the definitions file as a "Know Threats", then it can be automatically removed. If you want me to examine your files please consider making a donation.

= Why does the wp-login.php file show up as a vulnerability (even on a fresh install of WordPress)? =

The WordPress Login page is susceptible to a brute-force attack (just like any other login page). These types of attacks are becoming more prevalent these days and can sometimes cause your server to become slow or unresponsive, even if the attacks do not succeed in gaining access to your site. This plugin can apply a patch that will block access to the WordPress Login page whenever this type of attack is detected. For more information on this subject [read my blog](http://gotmls.net/tag/wp-login-php/).

= What if the scan gets stuck part way through? =

First just leave it for a while. If there are a lot of files on your server it could take quite a while and could sometimes appear to not be moving along at all even if it really is working. If, after a while, it still seems really stuck then try the Complete Scan or try running the scan again. If it stops in the exact same place then you may want to try to figure out what file in that folder is causing it to hang or avoid scanning that folder all together. If you figure it out let me know what it was and I will try and make the program find it's own way around that problem.

= How did I get hacked in the first place? =

This was most likely a random attack on your file-system by a hacker's robot/virus (automated script). This is usually because you are running an older version of WordPress or have installed a Plugin or Theme with vulnerabilities, or because your site is on a shared server with other exploitable sites that got infected. In some cases it's possible that your hosting provider got hacked at a root level and all their clients on that machine got infected.

= What can I do to prevent it from happening again? =

There is no sure-fire way to protect your site from any kind of hack attempt. That said, some of the basic steps should include: hardening your password, keeping all your sites up-to-date, and regular scans with Anti-Malware software like [GOTMLS.NET](http://gotmls.net/)

= Why does sucuri.net or the Google Safe Browsing Diagnostic page still say my site is infected after I have removed the malicious code? =

sucuri.net caches their scan results and will not refresh the scan until you click the small link near the bottom of the page that says "Force a Re-scan" to clear the cache. Google also caches your infected pages and usually takes some time before crawling your site again, but you can speed up that process by Requesting a Review in the Malware or Security section of [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/). It is a good idea to have a Webmaster Tools account for your site anyway as it can provide lots of other helpful information about your site.
